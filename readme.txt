Synotune is Open Syno's little brother. (http://opensyno.seesharp.ch)

Synotune is an immersive metro-style client for Synology NAS and makes use of the webservices exposed by the NAS's firmware.

For now, Synotune focuses less on the mobile aspect ( which is clearly Open Syno's focus ).

Instead, the idea behind Synotune is to bring your music to your living room, with an unrestricted datatransfer amount and relatively fast and reliable connectivity.

This last might change in the future to support more mobile scenarios, but as far as the current vision is concerned, it is not a priority.

Synotune is still at a very early development stage and there is still a long way to go until we reach production quality.

We hope this app will pique your interest and we hope you will enjoy using it, or even better, give us a hand developing it !

Note : no licence ahs been picked yet, but it will definitely be open-source : free as in both speech & beer.
